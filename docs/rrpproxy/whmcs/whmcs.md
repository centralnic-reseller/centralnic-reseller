# WHMCS

>>>>> **Web Hosting Automation Made Easy**

WHMCS (Web Host Manager Complete Solution) is an all-in-one domain provisioning, client management, billing/invoicing, and client support solution for any business selling through a website. WHMCS has become the World Leader in this market. By coupling WHMCS with one of CentralNic Brand's Registrar Module - namely HEXONET, RRPproxy, internet.bs and TPP WholeSale, anyone can start reselling hundreds of profitable domain name extensions (TLDs) quickly and in ease.

WHMCS allows to send high quality professional looking invoices to customers with its billing functionality. This functionality is no obstacle when it comes to deal with different currencies and tax support. It combines a lot other great features such as automated reminders for unpaid invoices, setting up late fees rules, supporting several payment gateways and many more.

WHMCS can be accessed using two APIs - an [Internal API](https://developers.whmcs.com/api/internal-api/) and an [External API](https://developers.whmcs.com/api/getting-started/). Thus, it allows users flexible ways to perform all necessary Operations. Regarding Domain Registrars, WHMCS comes with a regularly triggered [Domain Synchronization Process](https://docs.whmcs.com/Domain_Synchronisation) that cares about keeping the Status and the Expiry Date of a Domain in Sync with the underlying Registrar's System by invoking the Registrar's Module Integration for this Process. 50 Domains are covered per run and only Domains in Status `Pending Transfer` and `Active` are considered.

If you have not yet WHMCS set up, please follow their [Installation Guide](https://docs.whmcs.com/Installing_WHMCS) which explains the Installation Process completely and well. System Requirements can be found [here](https://docs.whmcs.com/System_Requirements) - there you'll also find notes about the support of specific platforms like Windows. You should be aware of all that.

## CentralNic Brands

Find further information [here](https://www.centralnicgroup.com/reseller/) and some notes about the WHMCS Integrations below:

### HEXONET / ISPAPI

The Team at HEXONET is the WHMCS Lead in the CentralNic Group and maintains its own version of the HEXONET Registrar Module (aka. `ISPAPI`) which should be used _instead_ of the WHMCS built-in Module. As we maintain this module, we can ensure that it covers the latest Patches and supports all WHMCS Features. In addition we offer a shorter Release Cycle than the one of WHMCS itself. This allows us to immediately work on Patches or new Features and to release independently of WHMCS.

HEXONET offers additional Provisioning Modules for WHMCS that allow for reselling of further Products like SSL Certs, Premium DNS, and Domain Backorders. Also, we have Add-Ons and Widgets in our Portfolio which can be flexibly combined with each other and which offer a certain added value. Like Importing Domains, Module Version Overview etc.

Our Reputation is speaking - just check the WHMCS Community Board e.g. [here](https://whmcs.community/topic/301180-who-is-the-best-domain-registrar-for-resellers-today/).

We are doing our best to push your business to satisfaction. We don't care about your number of domains - customer is king!

### RRPproxy / Key-Systems

The Team at HEXONET also maintains its own version of the RRPproxy Registrar Module (aka. `Key-Systems`) which should be used _instead_ of the WHMCS built-in Module. The above information applies also here, except the availability of additional Modules and Widgets.

### internet.bs

The Team at internet.bs maintains its own version of the internet.bs Registrar Module (aka `ibs`) which should be used _instead_ of the WHMCS built-in Module. Find it [here](https://github.com/internetbs/whmcs-internetbs-registrar).

### TPP WholeSale

The TPP WholeSale Registrar Module is shipped with WHMCS. There's no self-maintained Module available.
